            <h2>The story</h2>
            <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, </p>
            <blockquote>"We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate."</blockquote>
            <p>The farmer said, </p>
            <blockquote>“<strong>Maybe</strong>.”</blockquote>
            <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, </p>
            <blockquote>
                “Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events.
                You now have eight horses!”
            </blockquote>
            <p>The farmer again said,</p>
            <blockquote>“<strong>Maybe</strong>.”</blockquote>
            <p>
                The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
                The neighbors then said,
            </p>
            <blockquote>“Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,”</blockquote>
            <p>and the farmer responded,</p>
            <blockquote>“<strong>Maybe</strong>.”</blockquote>
            <p>
                The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
                Again all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn’t that great!” Again, he said,
            </p>
            <blockquote>“<strong>Maybe</strong>.”</blockquote>
            <p>
                The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is 
                <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune;
                or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p><span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
